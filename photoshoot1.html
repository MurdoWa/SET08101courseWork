	<h3><u>Photoshoot 1 - Washington DC</u></h3>
	<p> My most recent shoot, taken in september 2023. Alought having access to a proper dslr it was rarely used in this shoot, opting for my compact instead for its convience.
	during this trip I spent most of my time on a bus tour round the city hence why some of the photos are taken from so high up. Honestly not much to say on this shoot, the photos speak
	for themselves enjoy.

				<h3><u>Photo 1 - Washington Monument</u></h3>
				<p>Probably the most photographed building in washington second only to the whitehouse, this photo features the washington memorial as seen from the the lincoln memorial
				the photo was taken Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS-42 so i have no idea what the setting of the photo were but I think it did a pretty good job.
				also for some triva that I learned form taking this photo is that the monument is not straight, its about 2 degree to the right if the photo is alligned to the horrizon.</p>

				<h3><u>Photo 2 - Round Mystery</u></h3>
				<p>I wont lie, I dont know what this building is and couldnt find it online but that doesnt change the fact that it is super cool.
				Again this photo was taken on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS-42 so there arnt any settings to talk about other than the fact the flash was off (but you probably guessed that).
				IDK what to say about this photo to be honest, it wasnt really planned, I was on a bus and saw a cool building.

				<h3><u>Photo 3 - Skyline</u></h3>
				<p>Similar to the other 2 this photo was taken on the Panasonic so I dont have any setting to speak about (a theme for this shoot)
				Despite looking pretty simple this photo took quite alot of editing to achieve this look, the orginal had a car in the foreground and tons of street lights
				that really distracted from the look. This was easy to remove however with use of adobe photoshop's ai tool which i would highly recomed for removal in photos.				</p>
