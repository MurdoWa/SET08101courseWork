	<h3><u>Photoshoot 1 Botanical Gardens</u></h3>
	<p>Taken in early 2023 this shoot features a colection of photo from the edinburgh botanical gardens, there wasnt really a plan as such for this shoot
	rather just opting to take photos of what I could find. I did know going in that I wanted to photograph the wildlife of the area due to this being an area i rarely try to capture within my photos.

				<h3><u>Photo 1</u></h3>
				<p>This, to me, is the greatest photo I've ever taken. It was kind of taken by pure luck, when walking through the gardens a squirrel just came up to me so i snapped a photo.
					As for the settings I made sure to use a narrow appature and fast shutter speed, the day was bright so i could afford to do this, unfortunalty though the Squirrel is slightly out of focus.

				<h3><u>Photo 2</u></h3>
				<p>This allows for the introduction of all the features I planned for the website with the introduction of the navigation bar at the top of the page as well as some of photos that help clarify what the website is to be about. I also settled on the use of a footer that shall appear across all webpages in order to help the pages consistent as well as make the website clearly mine. The large about section in the middle will consist of information about what the website is about as well as what kind of photography I actually do.</p>
