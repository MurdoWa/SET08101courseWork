	<h3><u>Photoshoot 1 Botanical Gardens</u></h3>
	<p>Taken in early 2023 this shoot features a colection of photo from the edinburgh botanical gardens, there wasnt really a plan as such for this shoot
	rather just opting to take photos of what I could find. I did know going in that I wanted to photograph the wildlife of the area due to this being an area i rarely try to capture within my photos.

				<h3><u>Photo 1 Squirrel</u></h3>
				<p>This, to me, is the greatest photo I've ever taken. It was kind of taken by pure luck, when walking through the gardens a squirrel just came up to me so i snapped a photo.
					As for the settings I made sure to use a narrow appature and fast shutter speed, the day was bright so i could afford to do this, unfortunalty though the Squirrel is slightly out of focus.

				<h3><u>Photo 2 Duck</u></h3>
				<p>Like the photo of the squirrel this photo was just luck, i saw a duck sitting still in the water and decided I wanted to photograph it. 
				Since the duck was sitting so perfectly still i was able to use a slightly longer shutter speed to smooth out the water and generally brighten the photo.
				Overall a very successful photo that i really like (realistically it is my best photo of the shoot but I have a soft spot for the squirrel photo)				</p>

				<h3><u>Photo 3 Flower</u></h3>
				<p>Honestly not the best photo in its current form but I think its worth including for the sake of showing how one of my completely unedited photo looks	
					if I where too edit this photo i probably emphasize the shadows, would help with the washed out look of the photo current.	
					I'd potentially change the aspect ratio to be wider rather than taller, would help enpasis the width of the tree.
