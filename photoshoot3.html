		<h3><u>Photoshoot 1</u></h3>
		<p>Not orginally a shoot I planned for this website but unfortunitly I lost the sd with all my photos by the time I came to make this page.
			However we move on, this shoot if rather old, pre covid at least and was ceated with the idea of getting closes ups of flowers in order to see how close this lens could go.
			All the flowers pictured where at the Castle Kennedy gardens.

				<h3><u>Photo 1 - Blue Flower</u></h3>
				<p>Due to the loss the orinal raw I cannot tell any the camera setting for this shoot unfortunately, but i can tell you that what i remeber: the shutter speed was fast, iso was low and the aperture is wide.

				<h3><u>Photo 2</u></h3>
				<p> The camera setting of this shoot are very similar to the blue flower photo aloud i would suspect it has a narrow aperture.
					This is my a favorite of the three photo with the colours looking very pleasing to my eye.

				<h3><u>Photo 3</u></h3>
				<p> Unlike the other two photos I have a good memory of taking this photo in particular, with it being the first photo of the shoot.		
				Due to it being the very first photo I hadn't got the setting perfect yet with i believe too fast a shutter speed, hence the darker image.			
				Despite all that i think the came out well with its difference from the other photos helping it stand out.
