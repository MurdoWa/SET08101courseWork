	<h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
	<p>My name is Murdo Wallace, I 19 years old and have absolute no idea to write here.	
	I've been doing photography for years now, ever since I got my fist DSLR. I vary in what I like to picture within my photos,	
	more recently it's been tourist photography as a way to document where ive been and what I've seen most recently Washinton DC.	
	I'm based in Edinburgh and the west of Scotland alough neither appear within my photos too often.	
	This website in particular has been made as part of a university assigment.

			<h3><u>Nikon D3400</u></h3>
			<p>This is my main camera, a nikon d3400 with a 18-55mm lens attached, its features 24.2 MP resilution which, at the time was pretty good.
			I've owned this camera since around 2018 (cant remeber the exact date so it may have been eariler) and since then it has been round the world with me
			so most of the photo you see will have been taken on this photo.

			<h3><u>Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS-42</u></h3>
			<p>A more recent aqusition of mine this was a very good camera in its day with its 10mp sensor and 4x optical zoom and up to 7x digital zoom.
			Now however this camera does look dated but to me thats its charm, the software built into this camera just helps to make some very intresting photos, straight form the early 2000s.
			For sentiment reasons this camera will alawys be special to me with its crack in the body and history within my family.
